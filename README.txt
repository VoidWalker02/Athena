Athena is a Discord Bot made for playing songs in your personal server!
I've always needed bots that play youtube videos, and after most of them bit the dust, I made mine for personal use
since they're rather invaluable for things like TTRPG sessions over Discord.

Once you've set up the bot on Discord Developer Portal, you can use this file to get it working on your server.
This is a working prototype of the bot and more features will be added, but it currently supports:

- Play
- Pause
- Loop
- Skip
- Resume
- Join
- Leave

For now, you'll need the Python libraries used in the file to run in your machine
Similarly, don't forget to add bot.run("bot_token") with your own token at the end of the file!

Hope this is useful to someone else as it was to me. More updates to come.
